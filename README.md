# budget tracker & projection 🦅

i am building this to fill in the gaps of my knowledge around full-stack development, learn proper end-to-end workflows, and test myself by building everything myself 😵‍💫

## 🤖 current development
- staging & prod worfklows fully working and nice (even though its only mean developing and using lol)
- python FastAPI forecaster using meta prophet!
- a nice fancy ui (that i am procrastinating designing)

## ✨ future goals & features
- nicely visualise my spending weekly & monthly
- have AI tell me off for spending too much money on deliveroo
- have personalised insights into my spending and forecast if i am going to spend too much in a certain month
- integrate with my calendar!! (future)
- add friends and get notified when they overspend in a category they said they wouldnt (without banking APIs this is not feasible)
